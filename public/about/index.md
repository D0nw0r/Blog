**Binary Sunset** is meant to be a collection of researches/struggles/ideas that I found some value in sharing with the security community.
In this field, I cannot count the number of times that a "random" blog has saved me when facing an uknown problem. Hopefully someone else will find these posts helpful.


## A little bit about me

Learning about stuff, hacking stuff and writing stuff that hacks stuff are just about my favorite things.
With an original background in programming, I have a passion for anything low level code related.

## What you'll see here
Posts related with vulnerability research, exploit development, malware development, or just things I may find worth sharing!
And because half the value is in documenting the struggles, not just the victories, I am aiming to document the roller-coaster that is the process of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities.

## Why "Binary Sunset"?

A nod to one of the most iconic scenes in Star Wars, where Luke stares at twin suns on Tatooine. It represents looking at something familiar from a different perspective â€“ much like security work, where we examine systems through an adversarial lens.

Plus, I'm a huge Star Wars nerd. Had to sneak that in somewhere.

## Get in Touch

Always happy to chat about security, exploitation techniques, or debate which Star Wars trilogy is actually the best. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/real_donwor), [GitHub](https://github.com/D0nw0r), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/diogo-cardoso-fe).

May the Force be with you. ðŸŒ…
